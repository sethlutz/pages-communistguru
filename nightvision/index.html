				From the Preface to <i>Night-Vision: Illuminating War and Class on the Neo-Colonial Terrain</i>:
				</p><blockquote>
					<b>The transformation to a neo-colonial world has only begun, but it promises to be as dramatic, as disorienting a change as was the original european colonial conquest of the human race. Capitalism is again ripping apart & reconstructing the world, and nothing will be the same. Not race, not nation, not gender, and certainly not whatever culture you used to have.
					<br><br>
					Now you have outcast groups as diverse as the Aryan Nation and the Queer Nation and the Hip Hop Nation publicly rejecting the right of the u.s. government to rule them...
                    <br><br>
                    All the building blocks of human culture - race, gender, nation, and especially class - are being transformed under great pressure to embody the spirit of this neo-colonial age.</b>
